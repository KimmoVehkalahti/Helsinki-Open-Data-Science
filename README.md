# Helsinki Open Data Science 

This repository includes the materials related to the University of Helsinki course "Introduction to Open Data Science" (IODS), taught since 2016 by <b>Kimmo Vehkalahti</b>. At some point (perhaps in 2022?) it will be necessary to get rid of DataCamp on this course, as it can not be updated anymore.

The original DataCamp course was created by <b>Tuomo Nieminen</b> and <b>Emma K채m채r채inen</b> in 2016 and <b>Petteri M채ntymaa</b> in 2018.
