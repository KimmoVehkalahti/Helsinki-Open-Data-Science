# Helsinki Open Data Science 

This repository includes some materials related to the University of Helsinki course "Introduction to Open Data Science" (IODS), taught since 2016 by <b>Kimmo Vehkalahti</b>. 

Originally, these materials were part of a DataCamp course "Helsinki Open Data Science" that formed a part of the IODS course. The DataCamp course was created by <b>Tuomo Nieminen</b> and <b>Emma K채m채r채inen</b> in 2016 and <b>Petteri M채ntymaa</b> in 2018.

In 2022 we had to get rid of the DataCamp course, as it could not be updated anymore on the DataCamp platform. Since then, we have used the materials for exercises done in RStudio.
